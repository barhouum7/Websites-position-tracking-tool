# Websites-position-tracking-tool
I'm currently in creating a website's position tracking tool on the search engines.
# I will put my project notes here.❤
You can visit my website from this link 👉👉 https://barhouum7.github.io/Websites-position-tracking-tool.github.io/ Big thanks, hope have you a nice experience.😉
  ## How? 💻
  Download the SQL dump file of a database, Then you can manage the database using PhpMyAdmin.
  In the navigation, go to Import. In there, upload the SQL dump.
  Then you can use the dynamic website in your localhost. Enjoy!😃
